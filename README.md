# ros2-autonomous-navigation-system
ROS2-based autonomous navigation stack with real-time communication, built using rclpy, Gazebo, and RViz.

🚀 This project demonstrates a ROS2-based autonomous navigation system developed using rclpy, geometry_msgs, and the ROS2 navigation stack. The system was simulated in Gazebo, with visualization in RViz, and features:

📌 95% localization accuracy in simulated environments

⚡ 40% faster path-planning using optimized motion strategies

🔁 Custom action clients for real-time feedback and control

🧠 Automated parameter tuning reducing calibration time from 3 hours to 45 minutes

The goal was to replicate real-world autonomous robot behavior in a digital twin environment, while ensuring robust communication and dynamic adaptability.
